Mosquitos love me. If I walk outside at night to put out the trash, I will get bitten. Every summer I get dozens of terrible bites, so I decided to experiment with various cures. I tried ointments and medicines, but only one method cures my itch for good.

To find a solution, let's understand the problem. Why do mosquito bites itch?

When a mosquito bites you, it injects you with its saliva, which makes it easier for the mosquito to drink your blood. This saliva includes foreign proteins that cause a histamine immune response. People are allergic to mosquito proteins. The reaction activates nerves which signal inflammation and itchiness. We don't know exactly why "pruriceptive itch" exists, but maybe this pathway helps draw your attention and increase blood flow. Tests on animals show that this irritation can last up to a week. My bites can last much longer than that. Some people are especially allergic to mosquitos.

What's the solution? Anti-histamines and other ointments temporarily calm the irritation, but there is another way. Human cells are more resistant to heat than mosquitos' saliva is. Heating the bite denatures mosquito proteins, increases blood circulation to the area, and reduces inflammation.

What's the best way to do this?

My favorite way to heat up the bite is with a metal spoon. Here are the steps:
1. Boil water and pour it into a teacup.
2. Allow water to heat a metal spoon.
3. Touch the spoon with your hand to make sure it won't burn you.
4. Apply the spoon to the bite.

The spoon feels MUCH hotter on the bite than on your hand. Honestly, it can hurt. Here are my steps to tolerate the heat:
1. Start by bouncing the spoon on the bite.
2. As you can tolerate more heat, gently press it into the bite.
3. Once the spoon is cool, reheat it in the hot water.

Continue heating the bite. Roll the spoon over the surface of the bite until the teacup water cools.

That's it! 

Your skin may be blotchy for a day from the inflammation, but the itchiness will be gone for good.

Note: This method does not work on non-mosquito bites (e.g. horse flies).
