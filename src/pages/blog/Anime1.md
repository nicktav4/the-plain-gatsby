Hello beautiful nerds.

That's how Roman Mars of podcast *99 Percent Invisible* greets his audience. Of course, it's no small tribe. If you have any passion, interest, or curiosity then you're one of us. We, the reality show connoisseurs and coding dweebs, hip hop nerds and political geeks, video game dorks and baseball mathletes, share some cultural education that offers up an ever-changing internal syllabus. So, unless you are boring as heck, you too are some magnificent nerd, and I hope you practice your love shamelessly. 

Since we're all nerds here, let's talk about one of the most diverse, deep, and nuanced areas of nerd worship: anime.

I grew up in the suburbs of New York in the late '90s, and I still remember computer-lab printed pictures of golden-haired Super Saiyans taped to the liberty-green lockers of the upperclassmen. My younger brother and I would get home and turn on *Toonami*, eating dinner in front of the television on the few days when our parents relented to our begging and promises of good behavior. Our burly hero's shout would crescendo as he summoned even more power, energy auras enveloping his bulging muscles like flames, and adrenaline rushed through our adolescent bodies in a way drugs can only ever weakly emulate. At that age, I didn't know anything about Japan or why anime was different from regular Saturday Morning Cartoons. I didn't need to. The high-energy impact of each punch rang in my ears as I looked on with wide, unblinking eyes. As the end credits rolled, the reality of the aforepromised cleaning and homework wasn't enough to settle my pounding heart. My hunger for the latest chapter in the saga rose to a nervous tenor during the week I had to wait (years before we could stream massive libraries on-demand). Later, my discovery of *Adult Swim* opened the animation flood gates. Late at night, I watched *Trigun*, *Cowboy Bebop*, and *Inuyasha* with the sound turned down so low as to be barely audible, my finger on the power button in case my parents woke up. 

Over time I played sports, got a job, and spent my free time gaming. The growing power levels and katana flurries that once enthralled me became typical and boring. Finally, I moved to college and lost any remaining interest in those shows. Adult Swim was no longer my anime paradise. “Anime was fun when I was a kid,” I thought, “I'm not really into that anymore.” Years later at a friend’s suggestion, I started watching *Tatami Galaxy* and *From the New World*, and I began to realize the true breadth of the medium. It pulled me in and filled me up like never before. I had been watching American television and movies my whole life, and I found myself asking what it was about these animations that touched me so deeply? What is it that resonated with me in the ways that only great fiction can? Can it be boiled down to shared-interest forum weirdos pounding on their backlit keyboards about the philosophy of cartoons? I found my answers in *Your Lie In April*, a show about a young pianist that struggles to find purpose after the death of his abusive mother. As I, aged twenty-something, finished the last episode, I sat hunched in my room ugly-crying my eyes out. I was shocked at myself. Kafka says we should read things that stab and wound us, but never had fiction ever hurt me in such a cathartic way. So many of these Japanese animations communicate a bare vulnerability that is typically hidden or non-existent in the Invincible Heroes of American Drama and Comedy. There is something here that is deeply and uniquely human.

In the time that followed, with the benefit of modern technology, I watched show after show pursuing that feeling of connection that makes our hero's pain our pain, and our heroine's victory our victory. With some reflection, I found that these shows began teaching me a lot about my real-life connections--about depression and isolation, loss and grief, and the bravery in vulnerability.

So, whatever you fancy, don't let pastimes merely pass time. Be a student, dig deep, connect, and let yourself feel something. Maybe, together, we can learn from the art in this precious and wild world.
