#The Beginning of Belief

How do we believe? It seems that a person comprehends an idea, and then believes or rejects that idea. Amazingly, studies have shown that belief and comprehension are inseparable, and one can only reject or strengthen a belief if in possession of sufficient mental resources. This seems to contradict the common concept of belief. Here, we explore how we believe.

According to René Descartes a person passively comprehends an idea, and may thereafter believe or reject that idea. Descartes wrote that the willful power to reject or accept an idea was so obvious that it must be considered one of the primary innate notions of the mind. My experience of being an independent person, a free agent in society, is that I actively choose whether to believe or reject an idea. How can it be any other way?

Baruch Spinoza developed a different model. Spinoza suggested that comprehension and belief occur simultaneously, and rejection (or certification) revise accepted beliefs. According to Spinoza, all ideas are fundamentally beliefs. 

It seems Spinoza’s and Descartes’ systems would have the same result. What does it matter if acceptance precedes rejection? Given equal information, won’t both systems reject false statements? The reason the process of belief is significant is that humans have limited time and energy, the different processes can be cut short, and will then have different results. The results of such limitations are testable.

The Cartesian system predicts that a person with limited resources would comprehend an idea, but not assess it. The Spinozan system predicts that such a person would comprehend and accept the idea, but be prevented from rejecting or further certifying it. Which system does the evidence support?

#Examining Life

Psycholinguistics is the study of the relationship between how we think and what we say. Language has dominant words such as the word ‘happy’. A scale of happiness includes unhappiness, while the word ‘unhappy’ only describes the scale’s negative side. Spinoza’s system suggests that rejection is more complicated than acceptance. The words for acceptance are dominant: ideas are acceptable, not unrejectable; one believes, not undoubts; a thing is true, not unwrong. This phenomenon is not limited to English--in Latin, too, it is more complicated to reject an idea than to accept it.

In the mental development of children, doubt is one of the last linguistic abilities to emerge. If Descartes is right and acceptance and rejection are two sides of the same coin, shouldn’t we expect children to reject ideas as easily as they accept them? It seems disbelieving is more demanding than believing.  Children behave as we would expect from a half-grown Spinozan system.

Not only is doubt the last mental process to develop, but it’s also the first to disappear. Consider the police suspect or the political prisoner. All interrogators know that beliefs are most easily instilled when people are mentally exhausted. Dr. Charles Vincent, a victim of China’s reeducation process, recalled that “You are annihilated, exhausted, you can’t control yourself, or remember what you said two minutes before. You feel that all is lost. From that moment the judge is the real master of you. You accept anything he says.” By limiting a victim’s mental resources, a jailer might erode one’s ability to doubt, and may then force a confession or acquire some other information. 

#Laboratory Findings

As we move out of prisons and into labs, a more gentle way to exhaust test subjects is to have them juggle several tasks simultaneously. Tests have shown that subjects that are busy performing a task are more likely to believe a claim made during that task, even when the claim is dubious. Why is it that fatigued and distracted individuals are more susceptible to persuasion?

A person that is busy or exhausted lacks the opportunity to elaborate an idea in their mind. Descartes’ system suggests a distracted person should be uncertain, not persuaded. However, scientists observe what Spinoza’s system suggests: resource depletion prevents the rejection of ideas. In Spinoza’s model, the freedom to reject is accompanied by the ability to certify or strengthen an idea. Indeed, experimenters found that depleted individuals not only accept doubtful claims but are also unable to strengthen their certainty in reasonable claims. 

Experimenters developed a computer model that predicted human response times assuming that they operated in a Spinozan way. The computer model predicted that people would be quicker to confirm true rather than false statements. The model was startlingly accurate. What the experimenters found was that our minds initially code an idea as true, and when an idea and its representation disagree, further mental work must be done to reject the initial idea.

Negative statements are about affirmative statements, while affirmative statements are about the world. Since negative statements contain both an assertion and an instruction to reject that assertion, the Spinozan system makes a unique prediction. If humans are Spinozan they should occasionally believe the assertions they hear denied. For instance, participants that heard denials of bad behavior “She did not steal the cookie” were left with a poorer impression than neutral statements “She walked to the store”. If the Spinozan hypothesis is true, this poorer impression should be exacerbated by resource depletion, such as when participants interpret a sentence and identify a sound at the same time. In this case, resource depletion did not cause subjects to believe that affirmative propositions were false, but it did cause them to believe that denied propositions were true. The Cartesian model predicts no such asymmetry. 

The Spinozan system makes two claims: (1) acceptance precedes rejection and (2) comprehension and acceptance are simultaneous. Up to this point, we have only considered the first claim. Perhaps it is the case that acceptance precedes rejection (as in the Spinozan system), but comprehension and acceptance occur independently (as in the Cartesian system). Resource-depletion would cause this “Cartozan” system to show a bias toward accepting whatever propositions it assessed, but it would not necessarily assess those propositions it comprehended. Can one understand a proposition without believing it?

To comprehend an idea, one must imagine what the world would be like granted that idea. However, it’s possible that comprehension allows the option to choose whether to assess something as true. If this is so, then one would expect people who are faced with invalid information to be able to comprehend without acceptance. So, how do people deal with invalid information?

Subjects were asked to distinguish between real and fake suicide notes, and researchers gave them feedback on their performance. Researchers later confessed that the feedback had been completely unrelated to the subjects’ performance. Despite this, subjects persisted in believing the invalid feedback. Similar experiments have been repeated with the same results. These results suggest that people are poor at rejecting ideas that they first comprehend. In these investigations where information invalidity was revealed after it was comprehended the Cartozan, Spinozan, and even Cartesian systems are all capable of displaying such effects, and so the test had to be altered.

Researchers repeated the performance-feedback study, but rather than confessing to subjects after giving them phony feedback, the researchers told subjects about the invalidity of the feedback before the subjects received it. Despite this warning, subjects still believed the feedback. Repetitions of this study strengthen its results: subjects are unable to merely comprehend. Only a Spinozan system should behave this way. 

To deepen this investigation experimenters took a more direct approach. Experimenters taught subjects about the anatomy and environment of a fictional animal, the furry glark. After this lesson, subjects were asked to assess whether certain statements about glarks were true. Subjects were asked to read statements about glarks quickly enough that they are unable to assess the statements. A benefit was tied to reading speed in an attempt to prevent mental elaboration. Even though the subjects had been given a prior lesson (glarks have white fur), subjects regarded the quickly read statements (glarks have brown fur) as true. Subjects were unable to represent comprehended statements neutrally, even when directly motivated to do so.

Researchers investigated the ways in which human beings entertain mere possibilities and have found strong tendencies for people to seek information that confirms those possibilities. Experimenters asked people to entertain a hypothesis and then to rate the usefulness of relevant information. Researchers found that a person that entertains a belief finds information that may confirm that belief to be more useful and informative. By merely entertaining an idea, people tend to embrace it, and then prioritize supporting evidence.

Research has found that one of the few effective methods to relieve this confirmation bias is to ask individuals to comprehend a proposition's opposite. When subjects were led to think about another person as an introvert before testing the possibility that the person was an extrovert, they showed no tendency to conduct a biased search for supporting evidence. In fact, a simple request to consider both an idea and its opposite is far more effective than an appeal to be fair and accurate.

In conclusion, the existing history of evidence shows that acceptance of a proposition is part of the process of comprehension, when faced with limited time or energy, people may fail to reject a comprehended idea. Isn’t this strange? Why do human beings use the Spinozan system rather than the seemingly logical Cartesian or Cartozan systems?

#The Development of Belief

Visual perception may not just be a metaphor for thought. Our visual system is a powerful system for representation, and visual development predates cognition. Perhaps they are similar because the representational system for cognition built upon the brain’s existing visual image representation system. If this is so, the cognitive system would retain aspects of the perceptual system. As eyes represent an object in the mind, so too human understanding may represent propositions--to see with the mind that which can’t be seen with the eyes.

Of course, the accuracy of representations is critical--both visually and mentally. Indeed human societies punish liars, and through shame and guilt, individuals internalize this punishment. Humans are motivated to communicate accurate information and create an environment of trust. By trusting one’s eyes, one can act quickly in the physical world, and by trusting available propositions, one may act more efficiently in society. It may even be the case that the value of the time and energy saved by credulity is of greater social benefit than the loss caused by inaccurate beliefs.

When designers decided how to build a representative system for computers, the Cartesian model seemed to be the optimal system. Nature, however, does not start from scratch. Nature’s wanderings do not invent mechanisms as much as it modifies existing ones. The appearance of the physical world is more reliable than the communication of ideas, and so our belief system is made more clever by the added ability to reject its own representations. The Spinozan belief procedure appears to have developed this way, it retains features of visual perception but adds the process of certification and rejection. Perhaps it is no coincidence that thought-leaders are called visionaries, if you see my point.

#Final Words

It seems that, especially when exhausted or busy, a person is limited in their ability to reject ideas. To read, or watch, or listen at great length and be unpersuaded is a fantasy. One’s mind is no monarch over its beliefs. Beliefs are a republic of the environment, with the individual merely its President. It seems that if one seeks to exercise agency over their beliefs, they must be careful to choose what they consume. However stubborn and incredulous and confident we feel, how many beliefs do we hold that have been certified rather than merely accepted?
